# machine-theory-of-mind
This repo contains the code and technical documentation for a project between a few people (see 'People') whose aim is to reproduce and add to the study in the [Machine Theory of Mind](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07740.pdf) paper from DeepMind.


## Technologies
The DeepMind implementation doesn't mention specific technologies used, so I have made the following selection (subject to change as the project develops)

- Python
- Tensorflow
- Google Colab 

## Repository Structure
There are a few pieces

## People
Collaborators on the technical implementation side of the project

- Andy McMahon (Aggreko)
- Sofia Jativa (FHI, University College London)
- Stuart Russel (FHI, University of Oxford)
