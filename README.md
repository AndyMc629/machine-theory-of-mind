# machine-theory-of-mind
This repo contains the code and technical documentation for a project between a few people (see 'People') whose aim is to reproduce and add to the study in the [Machine Theory of Mind](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07740.pdf) paper from DeepMind.

## Technologies
The DeepMind implementation doesn't mention specific technologies used, so I have made the following selection (subject to change as the project develops)

- Python
- Tensorflow
- Google Colab 

## Repository Structure
There are a few pieces to this project so I suggest the repo will be structured roughly like this [example](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)

|-- README.md<br/>
|-- notebooks <br/>
|-- docs<br/>
|-- models<br/>
   >|-- experiment1s<br/>
    |-- experiment2s<br/>
    |-- experiment3s<br/>
    |-- characternetss<br/>
    |-- mentalnetss<br/>
|-- src<br/>
    |-- `__`init`__`.py<br/>
    |--<br/>
|-- data<br/>
    |-- gridworld<br/>
    |-- random-agents<br/>

## Workflow
Will use a worklflow and set up like that suggested [here](https://zerowithdot.com/colab-github-workflow/).
